# Fossil Learning Platform using Meson Codelab

## Abstract:

Welcome to the Fossil Learning Platform Codelab on using Meson! This codelab is designed to guide you through the process of working with the Meson build system, focusing on its core features without the use of external libraries like the Fossil Logic Core library (FLL). By the end, you'll have a better understanding of setting up Meson, creating custom libraries, and incorporating them into your educational materials.

## Codelab Overview:

## Fossil Updater tool

To simplify Meson and Ninja build installations, use our Fossil Logic Tool for managing updates, Fossil Updater:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dreamer-coding-555/fossil-updater.git
```

This command will download and install the project without the need to clone the repository first.

## Conclusion:

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the "Meson Build System" codelab. Feel free to adapt this template for your own codelabs, exploring different aspects of Meson.

Happy coding and learning with Meson! ðŸš€
