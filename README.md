## Fossil Updater tool

To simplify Meson and Ninja build installations, use our Fossil Logic Tool for managing updates, Fossil Updater:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dreamer-coding-555/fossil-updater.git
```

This command will download and install the project without the need to clone the repository first.
